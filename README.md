<h1>Build a SOC lab using Elastic Stack and a Kali Linux VM</h1>

 <h2>Description</h2>
The best way to learn AWS is to actually BUILD something with it. In this project, the system will send emails on a schedule, grabbing HTML email templates and a list of contacts from an S3 bucket. These are the services used to create this architecture: Simple Email Service (SES), EventBridge, S3, Lambda, and Identity & Access Management (IAM).
